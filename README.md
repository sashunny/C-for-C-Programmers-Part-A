		-:C++ For C Programmers on Coursera Part A:-

	Easy to comprehend solutions for the three homework assignments have been provided in this repository.

	Please refer to this only after trying on your own. I have not used Priority Queue to solve for Dijkstra,
	so the time complexity is o(n^n), where n is the number of nodes. 


There are 3 homework assignments in total.

Homework 1: Convert a C program to C++

Homework 2: Implement Dijkstra's Algorithm

Homework 3: Compute the minimum spanning tree (Prim) for an input graph, and read the 
            graph from a text file


REFERENCE VIDEOS FOR THEORY:

HOW TO EXECUTE :

1. Clone the repository or download it
2. Open the assignment of interest
3. open terminal and navigate to the build folder inside it
4. $ cmake ..
5. $ make
6. $ ./sampleCPP

If you do not have cmake then use compiler to build and execute the binary
